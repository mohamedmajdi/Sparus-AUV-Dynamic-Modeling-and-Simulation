# Sparus AUV Modeling and Simulation

## Introduction
Sparus autonomous underwater vehicle, developed by IQUA Robotics in Girona, Spain, is used in a wide range of underwater operations. The following sections will discuss the dynamic modeling of the Sparus vehicle by taking into consideration the stiffness, added mass, and damping effects. In addition, the dynamic model behavior in different underwater scenarios will be analyzed with the help of MATLAB & SIMULINK simulations.

The Sparus AUV is represented in the figure below. We consider the origin of the base "body" in the gravity center of the Sparus. It is placed at the x-position of the central thruster and at the middle of the cylinder.
